'''
The main function in this file is called noun_removal and it removes
the first noun or group of nouns in a string. A string in this function
is a complete and correct sentence. This means it contains all of the
necessary requirements that a sentence needs to be correct.

The function uses several helper function in order to remove the first
noun or group of nouns. The function also relies on the library called
spacy, which you can learn more about here: https://spacy.io/. Nouns in
a sentence are removed by looking at the part of speech (pos) of each
word and by looking at the dependencies between words in a sentence. I
import all of the functions from a file called nlpSpacy in order to
keep this file clean and only noun focused. The functions in nlpSpacy
break down an arbitary string and provide very useful information to
remove a specific pos, in this file we only remove nouns.

Args:
    s: A string that is a complete sentence. I will refer to the string
    as a sentence below.
Returns:
    A tuple with three inputs:
    The first input is list of tuples describing all of the words,
    including punctuation marks, in a sentence. Each tuple in this
    list contains a word, its dependency, and its pos. The second input
    contains a similar list as the first input in the return statement,
    but it does not contain the first noun or group of nouns in the
    sentence. The third input is a tuple with two arguments. The first
    argument is a list of tuples that contain the noun or group of
    nouns found. The second argument is a list that contains the
    respective index for each noun found.
