    "# Bert Experiments: One Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue our BERT experiments. We try to finetune *one* BERT model on *several* of our data sets. This makes it easier to deploy our solution in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a first test, we'll just train a BERT model that takes as input a response from any of several data sets, and outputs probabilities for *all* labels in *all* data sets. This is slightly suboptimal (after all, we don't need probabilities for labels that are not relevant to a specific prompt), but as long as we're not working with thousands of different labels, I don't think this is very problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup and preprocessing procedure is very similar to that in the first \"Bert experiments\" notebook. I'll highlight the areas where it is different."
