Are Surge Barriers Worth the Ecological Cost?
Climate change brings extreme weather
In 2012, Superstorm Sandy claimed about 150 lives and caused over $70 billion in damages in the United States. Scientists warned that Sandy was part of a growing trend: extreme weather events caused by climate change. The event sparked a national conversation between scientists, government officials, and American citizens.
Are surge barriers the answer?
With speeds reaching over 100 miles per hour, hurricane winds can drive water from the ocean towards coastal cities. When this happens, waves of seawater surge above the normal tide and crash through city streets, endangering lives and destroying neighborhoods and businesses. These storm surges are the leading cause of death during a hurricane.
In 2019, the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposed five different options to protect New York City against massive hurricane floods like those that damaged the city during Hurricane Sandy. The most expensive option, estimated at $118.8 billion, is a surge barrier made of concrete and steel. The five-mile-long, thirty-foot tall surge barrier would be built in the water between the Rockaways and New York Harbor. During storms, the city would be able to close the barrier’s gates, blocking storm surges. The USACE estimated that the barrier could save billions of dollars in property damage and countless lives.
The plans hit a wall
In New York, many environmental groups worried about how a surge barrier might affect marine ecosystems in New York Harbor and the Hudson River. New York Harbor and the Hudson River are home to a diverse array of marine creatures, including crabs, lobsters, herring, eel, and striped bass. 
Environmental advocates argued that the surge barrier could change these ecosystems in various ways. For example, the surge barrier could interrupt the spawning season for many fish. At particular times in the year, fish travel to new locations where they lay their eggs. A surge barrier could block certain fish from getting to their spawning locations and safely releasing their eggs. A surge barrier could also slow the flow of the water, causing some eggs to sink. This could pose a problem for fish eggs that need oxygen and must stay on the surface of the water in order to survive. 
Some environmental activists advocated for alternative solutions. Some proposed that New York City invest in building floodwalls and levees on the shore rather than surge barriers in the water. Advocates argued that those solutions would not have the same negative impact on the local ecosystem as surge barriers. Others offered entirely different solutions, such as raising up buildings and elevating New York City’s subway system.
In early 2020, the debate came to a sudden halt when the Trump administration decided not to fund the USACE’s surge barrier study in 2020. According to a White House official, the administration thought the study was too expensive. 
As New York and other coastal cities continue to endure extreme weather events, scientists, advocates, residents, and elected officials weigh in on the proposals. Are surge barriers the right option for New York City?
