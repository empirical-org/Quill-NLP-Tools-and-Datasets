Should Our Use of Plastic Bags be Regulated?

How often do you use plastic bags? Think about every time you buy snacks, shop for new clothes, or help your family get groceries. Each of these activities typically includes at least one plastic bag.

People in the United States use a lot of plastic bags. On average, every American uses about 360 plastic bags per year. Across the country, that adds up to more than 100 billion plastic bags.

Plastic bag production and disposal can be dangerous to people's health. These processes release toxic chemicals and microplastics (tiny plastic particles) into the air and water. Over time, they can cause people to develop serious health problems, including asthma and cancer.

Usually, plastic production and waste-management occur close to low-income communities. As a result, these communities are more likely to develop health problems.

Should city and state governments ban plastic bags?

In some areas, plastic bag reduction laws require stores to charge an extra fee for every plastic bag used. In other areas, these laws ban plastic bags entirely. Plastic bag reduction laws can help decrease the amount of toxic chemicals and microplastics released into the air and water. In particular, these laws can help protect the health of communities located closest to these plants. 

Many cities and states have recognized the beneficial or positive effects of plastic bag reduction laws. As a result, eight states have passed these laws. Hundreds of cities and towns have also passed their own plastic bag reduction laws.

Many places have already benefited from these efforts. Chicago, Illinois, and Richmond, California, now use over 30% fewer plastic bags.

How are people reacting to these laws?

People who work for plastic bag production and processing plants fear that these laws may cause them to lose their jobs. Instead of decreasing plastic bag production, they advocate for developing better recycling methods.

Many low-income shoppers worry that they may not be able to afford plastic bag fees or reusable bags. In response, some groups are helping people make the transition away from plastic bags. They are organizing events to make free, reusable bags widely available.

Plastic bag production and disposal are harmful to the environment and people's health. Are the benefits of reducing plastic bag usage worth the economic cost of changing how people shop?
