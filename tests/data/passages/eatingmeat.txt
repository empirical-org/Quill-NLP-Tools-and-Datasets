Should People Continue to Eat Meat?

What do burping cows and global warming have to do with each other? As it turns out, a whole lot. 

Every day, each of the world’s 1.5 billion cows burps out 30-50 gallons of the greenhouse gas methane. This gas causes Earth's temperature to rise in a process called global warming. 

Scientists have linked global warming to an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, heat waves, wildfires, and floods. They predict that as Earth’s temperature rises, these events will become more common. 

Cow burping and other aspects of animal agriculture, the practice of raising animals for food purposes, produce about 14.5% of the world's greenhouse gases.

Should we change what people eat?

To address this problem, the company Impossible Foods wants to end all animal agriculture by 2035. By creating plant-based ""meats"" that have the look, taste, and texture of real meat, Impossible is appealing to meat-eaters. In a recent taste test, half the people surveyed could not distinguish between Impossible Burgers and beef burgers. 

Fast-food chains like Burger King and White Castle have added these alternatives to their menus. According to Burger King, most of the people who order Impossible Burgers are meat-eaters. 

Since Impossible’s “meats” do not contain animal products, they are less harmful to the environment than regular meat. In fact, production of the Impossible Burger generates 89% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than beef burgers.

Or should we change what cows eat?

Not everyone shares Impossible Foods’ goal of ending animal agriculture. Some scientists and farmers have argued that there are other ways to make the practice better for the environment. 

Another solution lies in what farmers feed cows. Recent research has shown that when cows consume seaweed as part of their diets, they release up to 99% less methane in their burps. This solution could reduce about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture. 

Eating meat takes a large toll on the environment, but not everyone agrees on the best solution. How should we address the costs of animal agriculture?
