Junk Food: Should Schools Sell It?
		
Many young people acknowledge that eating too much junk food is not good for their health. They realize that soda, chips, and candy have little nutritional value. They know that these foods have too much sugar, salt, fat, and refined starches. Yet they continue to eat junk food regularly. Many also admit that they do not incorporate enough exercise into their daily routines.
					
There has been a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes among youth in more recent years. This has been linked to rising obesity rates. Diabetes is a disease in which either the body’s insulin levels are too low or the body does not respond to the insulin level that is present. The digestive system breaks down food to make glucose, which provides the body’s energy. Insulin is an important hormone that helps the body utilize glucose. Insulin is needed to transport glucose to muscles and other tissues of the body.
					
Despite the link between diabetes and weight, some think that schools should keep selling soda and snacks. They argue that students should have a choice about what they eat. Selling snacks also generates money for schools. Other people think that schools make junk food too accessible. They believe that schools should cooperate with health professionals on initiatives aimed at changing kids’ eating and fitness habits. For example, schools could fill snack machines with more nutritious foods.
					
Should schools sell the unhealthy snacks students want, or do they have a responsibility to promote healthy habits?
