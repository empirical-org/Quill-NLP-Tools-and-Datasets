Are Wind Farms a Good Alternative Energy Source?

Electricity powers our way of life
 
How much of your daily life is powered by electricity? When you flip a light switch, you're using electricity. When you turn on your television, you're using electricity. Electricity doesn't just power our homes—it powers our restaurants, schools, shopping centers, and workplaces. 

Earth pays the price for modern living

Electricity has a cost, though, and the earth is paying the price. Over 60% of Earth's electricity is generated by power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, or natural gas. Through this process, these power plants become a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
Greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise. Human use of fossil fuels accelerates and intensifies this "greenhouse gas effect," which scientists have connected to extreme weather events. In fact, they predict that as Earth's temperature continues to rise, droughts, floods, heatwaves, and hurricanes will occur more frequently.
Faced with a growing global crisis, environmental activists, businesspeople, and scientists have wrestled with the question, "How do we reduce greenhouse gases—and save the planet—while keeping our way of life?"

A breezy solution
 
Wind is one of humankind's oldest energy sources, and engineers have designed turbines that use it to power modern society. These machines capture wind power using large, fan-like blades. As the wind blows and turns these blades, generators spin and produce electricity.
Turbines, grouped on "wind farms" in the ocean or on land, can power entire communities with clean, emissions-free energy. Wind turbines rely solely on wind, so there's no need to burn coal, oil, or natural gas. By not burning fossil fuels, wind turbines produce clean energy without releasing greenhouse gases.
 
Some parts of the United States have already adopted wind energy. The town of Rock Port, Missouri, is powered entirely by wind. Rhode Island’s Block Island Wind Farm, the first offshore wind farm in the United States, can provide 17,000 homes with electricity. Wind power is becoming increasingly popular. States like Illinois, Indiana, New York, and Ohio are building wind farms to generate clean energy.
 
Recognizing wind power's environmental benefits, the United States has already built over 58,000 wind turbines throughout the country, Puerto Rico, and Guam. In 2019, the United States Department of Energy announced $28 million in funding for wind turbine research to further clean energy initiatives. Researchers will use the funding to study the latest developments in wind technology and find ways to lower the costs and risks associated with building offshore wind farms. Over the next decade, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management expects 2,000 turbines to be built off the East Coast's shore to generate additional clean energy. 
 
The cost of wind-power
 
While harnessing wind power is an emissions-free process, making wind turbines is not. Wind turbines are constructed from metals extracted from the earth through mining operations that release greenhouse gases. Plus, turbine parts are built in factories powered by fossil fuels, adding to greenhouse gas emissions. 
 
Wind turbine blades pose a threat to flying animals. Each blade is huge—about the width of a city bus—and can reach speeds of up to 179 miles per hour. At that speed and size, the blades are extremely dangerous to bats and birds that encounter the turbines in their flight paths. In all, wind turbines kill over 500,000 birds and 600,000 bats every year in the United States alone.
 
Wind technology can provide clean power, but it's not a perfect energy solution. Is the environmental cost of building wind technology and its impact on wildlife worth the clean energy that wind power provides?
