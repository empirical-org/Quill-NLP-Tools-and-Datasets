Does Title IX Promote Gender Fairness in Sports and Education?


In 2018, Eastern Michigan University was in financial trouble. The school expected to spend at least $4.5 million more that year than the budget allowed. In an effort to save money, the school reduced its sports programs. The men's wrestling, men's swimming and diving, women's tennis, and women's softball teams would not continue in the fall.

When softball player Ariana Chretien heard the news, she grew worried. The cuts meant that Chretien would have to choose between two of her passions-—softball and aviation. Although Chretien had received multiple softball scholarship offers, Eastern Michigan was the only school that also offered an aviation major. She explained, "My major is aviation, and not a lot of schools have that. So, either I find a school with aviation but no scholarships or scholarships but no major."

Chretien refused to accept the school's decision to cut the teams. She joined forces with Marie Mayerova, a tennis player. Together, they sued Eastern Michigan for violating Title IX (pronounced “title nine”).

In 1972, the federal government passed Title IX to promote gender fairness in education. In college athletics programs, Title IX requires schools to give men and women equal chances to play sports.

Chretien and Mayerova claimed that Eastern Michigan broke this law. They argued that women were already underrepresented in the school's sports teams. While about 60% of the student population was female, less than 45% of the school's athletes were women. The cuts, they said, would limit women's chances to play sports even more.

However, Eastern Michigan insisted that it did not violate Title IX. The school argued that the changes affected more men than women and it wasn't making their sports programs more unfair for women. That was true. Overall, the cuts reduced Eastern Michigan's sports programs by 25 women and 58 men.

Nonetheless, the court ruled that Eastern Michigan had violated Title IX. It noted that the school was out of compliance for at least 15 years. The judge emphasized that the cuts to the women’s teams made the situation even worse. He explained that the cuts showed that the school was not making enough effort to give women equal access to sports.

As a result, the judge ruled that the school would have to reinstate both women's softball and tennis to begin bringing Eastern Michigan into compliance with the law.

Over the years, Title IX has increased the presence of women in sports and education. However, some colleges still struggle to meet this obligation. How can schools prioritize Title IX while balancing other priorities?
