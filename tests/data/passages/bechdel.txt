Censorship: Who Should Decide What Young People Read?

Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home depicts her sexual awakening with images of her own memories of early intimacy. For Bechdel, who came of age in the 1970s, it was important to share an honest, personal story graphically.

Hailed as a “masterpiece,” Fun Home has been challenged and banned in some communities. 

Some argue that this imagery is “not appropriate for a high school curriculum,” stating that the  sexual imagery is “pornographic.” Bechdel responded to these criticisms of her work by pointing out that her work wasn’t erotic, it was autobiographical. Opposition to the book may lie more in sexuality than sex itself, as was the case in South Carolina. In 2014, the South Carolina House of Representatives cut funding to the College of Charleston for featuring  the book in a reading list because it was “promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle.”

However, one advocacy group against censorship is fighting back. The National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC), was formed to “promote freedom of thought, inquiry, and expression and oppose censorship in all its forms.” In response to efforts to ban Fun Home from schools, members of the NCAC wrote “Bechdel’s memoir is resonant with many youth experiences and offers teen readers a safe place to examine questions related to personal identity, family relationships, and the need to face the truth in their own lives.” Recognizing the dangerous precedent that could be set by banning Bechdel’s work, NCAC member Abena Hutchful wrote, “Restricting books like Fun Home further stigmatizes and marginalizes LGBTQ youth and fosters an atmosphere of intolerance."

If a book has important social value, but potentially controversial imagery, should it be banned?
