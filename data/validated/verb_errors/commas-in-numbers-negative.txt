Dylan claims that his pet turtle is over 1,000 years old.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, smallpox claimed the lives of over 400,000 people.
The National Vaccine Establishment reported that 4000 people died in the London every year from smallpox before the discovery of vaccination, but many people doubted the accuracy of the report.
In 1979 the World Health Organization declared victory; smallpox's 3,000 year reign of terror was over.
If the WHO was unsuccessful, smallpox would have continued to claim an estimated 5,000,000 per year.
Can you imagine saving over 5,000,000 lives every year, for over 40 years?
For over 40 years, smallpox's 3,000 year reign of terror has been reduced to a footnote in history.
Valerie crossed her fingers, looked up to the sky, and asked for a bit of luck; the lottery jackpot was 17,000,000 dollars.
The vikings at JG Wentwoth promised me 87,700 dollars in cash, right now!
"Where's the money, Lebowski?" the thugs shouted at Jeff, not realizing that he couldn't pay the 100,000 dollar ransom.
Max was in disbelief—he woke up to find 3,593,583 letters from his long-lost pet guinea pig.
Shockingly, his guinea pig was literate in 4,384,435 languages.
His dog, however, was literate in 5,383,920 languages.
Sometimes it feels like I will never be able to read all 4,280 emails sitting in my inbox.
I didn't expect Marcin to ask me to review and edit his essay 9,732,083 times!
I must've made 103,586,294 suggestions to him in Google Docs.
As hard as Marcin works, he'll never score above 2,400 points on his exam.
Raul, might beat Marcin's current high score of 1,820,013.
Raul has spent, on average, 2,243,8759 hours on his paper on the changes in his neighborhood.
All those hours of hard work could yield him a score of 78,476,294!
Knowing Raul's father, though, no score below 99,999,999 will be acceptable.
Raul's older sister, Jovita, managed to score 1,000,000,000 on her essay when she was in eigth grade.
The AI needs at least 304,003,382,729,491 sentence errors to truly learn to mimic a teacher's ability to identify mistakes in students' writing.
I'm afraid that we might only be able to provide the AI with 2,000 errors tonight, which is far below its training requirement.
I hope the AI doesn't punish me for such a low number by adding 57,393,859,204 extra minutes to my workday.
Maybe the AI will work in seconds, rather than minutes, and double my workday to 28,800 seconds.
Out of 508,302,00305,039 applicants, Kamran was selected for the job!
Kamran rewrote his letter of interest 4,030,298 times before finally submitting an application.
Fatma was the only person who qualified for all 37,738,290,101,847 positions on the naval ship.
By the time Fatma retired from the United States Navy, she'd earned 899,830,810,830 medals!
Fatma's parents were proud of her career accomplishments and spent their life's fortune—$4,322,045,934,095,004— to buy her a ship of her own.
Fatma's ship circled the globe, covering all 24,901 miles multiple times.
Fatma's ship employed 67,330 people, although she was clearly qualified for every position.
Sadly, one of her sailors quit, leaving the ship with a smear 67,329 people to run its daily operations.
That was okay, though, as he managed to train an army of 4,350,830 mice to do his job before he quit.
The mice had an army as well—6,083,058,020 well-trained fleas.
These fleas, in turn, also had little helpers—305,204,867 germs trained in mariner operations.
And wouldn't you know it, the germs brought with them 398,924,756,027,502,750 atoms, all charged for duty.
I can't count the number of times I've watched 'Withnail & I,' but I know the number is well over 503,300.
The 'Withnail & I' fanclub is pretty small—only 73,424 members worldwide.
When the movie was screened at the summer film festival, 1,2045,850 viewers were in attendance, so maybe the fanclub will grow.
The movie came out 33 years ago— that means it's been 1,2045 days since its intial release. 
I feel like it's going to be at least 8,758,302 days until the movie gets a sequel.
I bet Richard E Grant's mailbox is overstuffed with 5,940,302 fan letters.
Paul McGann, however, probably only gets 403,488 letters from fans.
Do fans even send letters anymore, or do they just spend 30,403,287 hours writing emails to their favorite stars?
One actor said he got 10,293,804,027,495 emails from one fan, then reported it to the police.
Daniel Day-Lewis is a method actor, so he probably spends 1,304,759,375 hours writing his own fan mail to put himself in the mind of an actor, which is strange, because he is one.
Mikaila turned the volume up to 4,038,405,038 on her stereo, but it didn't bother her because she has superhuman ears.
Mikaila's neighbors, howver, were bothered, and asked her to turn it down to 48,380.
