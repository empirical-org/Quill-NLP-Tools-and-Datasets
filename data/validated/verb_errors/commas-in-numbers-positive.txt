Dylan claims that his pet turtle is over 1000 years old.
During the 18th and 19th centuries, smallpox claimed the lives of over 400000 people.
The National Vaccine Establishment reported that 4000 people died in the London every year from smallpox before the discovery of vaccination, but many people doubted the accuracy of the report.
In 1979 the World Health Organization declared victory; smallpox's 3000 year reign of terror was over.
If the WHO was unsuccessful, smallpox would have continued to claim an estimated 5000000 per year.
Can you imagine saving over 5000,000 lives every year, for over 40 years?
For over 40 years, smallpox's 3000 year reign of terror has been reduced to a footnote in history.
Valerie crossed her fingers, looked up to the sky, and asked for a bit of luck; the lottery jackpot was 17000,000.
The vikings at JG Wentwoth promised 87700 dollars in cash, right now!
"Where's the money, Lebowski?" the thugs shouted at Jeff, not realizing that he couldn't pay the 100000 dollar ransom.
Max was in disbelief—he woke up to find 3593,583 letters from his long-lost pet guinea pig.
Shockingly, his guinea pig was literate in 4384,435 languages.
His dog, however, was literate in 5383920 languages.
Sometimes it feels like I will never be able to read all 4280 emails sitting in my inbox.
I didn't expect Marcin to ask me to review and edit his essay 9732,083 times!
I must've made 103586,294 suggestions to him in Google Docs.
As hard as Marcin works, he'll never score above 2400 points on his exam.
Raul, might beat Marcin's current high score of 1820,013.
Raul has spent, on average, 2243,8759 hours on his paper on the changes in his neighborhood.
All those hours of hard work could yield him a score of 78476294!
Knowing Raul's father, though, no score below 99999,999 will be acceptable.
Raul's older sister, Jovita, managed to score 1000000,000 on her essay when she was in eigth grade.
The AI needs at least 304003382729491 sentence errors to truly learn to mimic a teacher's ability to identify mistakes in students' writing.
I'm afraid that we might only be able to provide the AI with 2000 errors tonight, which is far below its training requirement.
I hope the AI doesn't punish me for such a low number by adding 57393,859,204 extra minutes to my workday.
Maybe the AI will work in seconds, rather than minutes, and double my workday to 28800 seconds.
Out of 50830200305039 applicants, Kamran was selected for the job!
Kamran rewrote his letter of interest 4030,298 times before finally submitting an application.
Fatma was the only person who qualified for all 37738290,101,847 positions on the naval ship.
By the time Fatma retired from the United States Navy, she'd earned 899830810830 medals!
Fatma's parents were proud of her career accomplishments and spent their life's fortune—$4322045934095004— to buy her a ship of her own.
Fatma's ship circled the globe, covering all 24901 miles multiple times.
Fatma's ship employed 67330 people, although she was clearly qualified for every position.
Sadly, one of her sailors quit, leaving the ship with a smear 67329 people to run its daily operations.
That was okay, though, as he managed to train an army of 4350,830 mice to do his job before he quit.
The mice had an army as well—6083058,020 well-trained fleas.
These fleas, in turn, also had little helpers—305204867 germs trained in mariner operations.
And wouldn't you know it, the germs brought with them 398924756,027,502,750 atoms, all charged for duty.
I can't count the number of times I've watched 'Withnail & I,' but I know the number is well over 503300.
The 'Withnail & I' fanclub is pretty small—only 73424 members worldwide.
When the movie was screened at the summer film festival, 12045,850 viewers were in attendance, so maybe the fanclub will grow.
The movie came out 33 years ago— that means it's been 12045 days since its intial release. 
I feel like it's going to be at least 8758,302 days until the movie gets a sequel.
I bet Richard E Grant's mailbox is overstuffed with 5940,302 fan letters.
Paul McGann, however, probably only gets 403488 letters from fans.
Do fans even send letters anymore, or do they just spend 30403,287 hours writing emails to their favorite stars?
One actor said he got 10293804027,495 emails from one fan, then reported it to the police.
Daniel Day-Lewis is a method actor, so he probably spends 1304759375 hours writing his own fan mail to put himself in the mind of an actor, which is strange, because he is one.
Mikaila turned the volume up to 4038405038 on her stereo, but it didn't bother her because she has superhuman ears.
Mikaila's neighbors, howver, were bothered, and asked her to turn it down to 48380.
