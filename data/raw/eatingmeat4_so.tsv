This solution could reduce about one-third of greenhouse	Feedback_9
one way or another governments need to recognize this threat and invest in a reasonable solution.	Feedback_9
farmers and anti-meat activists should work together towards a comprised, sustainable solution.	Feedback_9
to address this problem, creating plant-based "meats" that have the look, taste, and texture of real meat, is necessary to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture.	Feedback_9
cows should stop being bred for killing purposes and people should turn to man-made "meat-like" products to fulfil their protein needs.	Feedback_9

getting people to consume less beef would be a boon environmentally.	Feedback_9
it is better to go for plant based meats	Feedback_9
one way to help the environment is to require less cows for meat consumption.	Feedback_9
it would be effective in helping the changing climate by reducing the amount of meat that we eat so farmers won't need to raise so many.	Feedback_9
other options of food should be looked at.	Feedback_9
changes should be made.	Feedback_9
other ways to make the practice better for the environment.	Feedback_9
making meat products without meat may be a solution.	Feedback_9
it should be monitered for future consideration of green house gas reductions.	Feedback_9
more research is needed to determine the best away to reduce the amount of methane produced.	Feedback_9
it may be wise to pursue other methods of "beef" production such as the methods currently being employed by companies such as impossible Meat.	Feedback_9
strategies to reduce methane generation by animal agriculture must be developed.	Feedback_9
it is important to reduce it so that there is less of an impact on global warming.	Feedback_9
reduce the meat consumption to reduce agricultures harmful effects	Feedback_9
it would be wise to reduce eating meat and try substituting plant based meats.	Feedback_9

reducing our need for cows in our agriculture is a way to fight climate change.	Feedback_9
some people believe that is an argument for reducing meat consumption.	Feedback_9
reducing the amount they burp is important to reduce the greenhouse-gasses.	Feedback_9
reducing the numbers of animals that are raised for food, including cows, could have a positive impact on the environment.	Feedback_9
it may be better to replace meat products with plant based foods like those made by Impossible.	Feedback_9
replacing animal agriculture with plant based "meats" or changing the cows diet may reduce the harmful effects.	Feedback_9
an alternative is to stop eating meat and eat some other type of proteins, such as the fake meat served in many fast food restaurants and bought in supermarkets.	Feedback_9
the goal should be to stop using animals as food and go to a plant based diet.	Feedback_9
steps should be taken to solve the problem.	Feedback_9
non-meat alternatives that taste like meat should be explored.	Feedback_9
there is thought that eating meat takes a large toll and we should reduce the amount of meat particularly beef consumption.	Feedback_9
we should transition to plant based meats.	Feedback_9
it is important for meat-alternatives to be used more often.	Feedback_9
the use of alternatives such as meat substitutes may become necessary and more common especially in the fast food market.	Feedback_9
let's stop the methane in the first place.	Feedback_9
in order to reduce the amount of methane, there should be less cows.	Feedback_9
It would be best to try and reduce that amount.	Feedback_9
meatless foods is a great alternative.	Feedback_9
we need to do something about it.	Feedback_9
we need to do something about it as a planet.	Feedback_9
they need to have an alternative meat.	Feedback_9
this should be reduced either by shifting to plant based meat or adding impossible food in Cow's diet.	Feedback_9
one alternative to address this problem, is the consuming of plant based meat.	Feedback_9
if more fast food chains add these alternative meat products to their menus, there will be less harm done to the environment.	Feedback_9
changing to a plant based diet may help he environment.	Feedback_9
plant-based meats will help reduce the amount of methane.	Feedback_9
Impossible's alternative burgers are a good option because they emit 89% less greenhouse gas emissions than beef.	Feedback_9
it would be less harmful to the environment if humans consumed less meat products.	Feedback_9
eating meat and therefore supporting meat production agriculture is a contributing factor.	Feedback_9
feeding cows seaweed as part of their diet will reduce greenhouse gas emissions.	Feedback_10
introducing seaweed into their diet lessens the methane burps by 99%.	Feedback_10
one solution lies in changing what farmers feed cows and using seaweed as opposed to traditional feed.	Feedback_10

one third of green house gases would be reduced by feeding them lesss harmful food.	Feedback_10
the only solution to reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions is to change the cows diets and try to reduce the amount of meat consumption across the board.	Feedback_10
reducing the amount of methane the cattle produce would help to stop global warming.	Feedback_10
IF COWS CONSUME SEAWEED AS PART OF THEIR DIETS, THEY RELEASE UP TO 99% LESS METHANE IN THEIR BURPS, THIS CAN REDUCE ONE THIRD OF GREEN HOUSE GAS EMISSION	Feedback_10
there are options to resolve this issue such as changing the cows' diet, or opt for a plant meats that look, taste, and has the same texture as real meat to reduce animal agriculture.	Feedback_10
when cows consume seaweed as part of their diets, it could reduce about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture	Feedback_10
when cows consume seaweed as part of their diets, they release up to 99% less methane in their burps.	Feedback_10
if they consume seaweed as part of their diet, up to 1/3 of greenhouse gas emissions caused by animal agriculture could be reduced.	Feedback_10
the consumption of seaweed is an alternative for cows that ensures that 99% methane is released in their burps.	Feedback_10
changing what they eat can decrease the methane .	Feedback_10
changing their diets could help reduce this.	Feedback_10
farmers can feed cows differently such as feeding them seaweed which they would release up to 99% less methane in their burps.	Feedback_10
adding seaweed to the cow's diet can reduce the harmful gas emission by 99%.	Feedback_10
a unique solution of adding seaweed to cattle food could be an effective way to alleviate production of bovine methane.	Feedback_10
