the addition of seaweed to their diet reduses methane by 99 percent.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane produced by cow burps can be reduced by 99% by including seaweed as a part of the cow's diet.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane produced can be reduced significantly by adding seaweed to cows diets.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane released could be reduced by adding seaweed to cow's diets.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane released from cows can be reduced by adding seaweed to their diet.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane they burp can be reduced if they are given seaweed to eat.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane they release can be decreased when they are fed a diet of seaweed.	Feedback_13
the amount of methane they release into the environment can be reduced by changing the cows' diet to include seaweed.	Feedback_13
the amount they produce can be lowered by introducing seaweed into their diets.	Feedback_13
the burps can contain almost 90% less methane if there is seaweed mixed into their daily diets.	Feedback_13
the effect may be reduced by feeding cows a portion of seaweed in their diet which can reduce methane in their burps about 99%.	Feedback_13
the impact can be lessened by feeding cows seaweed.	Feedback_13
the problem can be mitigated by switching the food cows eat to seaweed, which causes cows to produce 99% lessmethsne	Feedback_13
the type of food a cow eats, such as seaweed, can drastically cut down on the release of that gas.	Feedback_13
their contribution to the greenhouse effect could be mediated by adding seaweed to their diets.	Feedback_13
their impact can be decreased by introducing seaweed into their diet.	Feedback_13
there are alternative food for cows, seaweed is one that will reduce methane 99%.	Feedback_13
there are alternatives, such as Impossible Meat (plant-based "meats" that have the taste and texture of the real thing) and changing the diets of cows to include seaweed; an abundant alternative that can reduce the amount of methane they	Feedback_13
there are foods to feed cows, such as seaweed, that can dramatically reduce the amount of methane found in cow burps.	Feedback_13
there are other things that can be done to decrease the amount of methane gas released by cows such as incorporating seaweed into feed.	Feedback_13
there are solutions, like Impossible burgers and them eating seaweed instead.	Feedback_13
there are some who believe that this can be alleviated by changing the food that cows consume such as feeding them seaweed which decreases the methane gas from cows burping by as much as 99%.	Feedback_13
there are ways to decrease the harm by feeding the cows seaweed.	Feedback_13
there are ways to farm that could eliminate some of that problem, like by feeding the cows seaweed.	Feedback_13
there are ways to possibly limit the gas if cows are fed seaweed as part of their diet.	Feedback_13
there can be a reduction in methane released by feeding cows seaweed in their diet instead of what they currently eat.	Feedback_13
there may be ways to decrease methane from cow burps, like feeding cows seaweed.	Feedback_13
they can be solved by feeding the cows seaweed which reduces the methane release by ninety nine percent.	Feedback_13
they can feed the cows seaweed and it will cut down the gases by 99%.	Feedback_13
they could be fed seaweed instead to decrease the release of methane.	Feedback_13
they could feed cows seaweed which released 99 percent less greenhouse gasses.	Feedback_13
they release up to 99% less methane in their burps when they consume seaweed as part of their diets.	Feedback_13
this can be fixed by feeding them a steady diet of seaweed.	Feedback_13
this could be mitigated by feeding them seaweed, which reduces methane by up to 99%.	Feedback_13
this problem can be diminished by including seaweed in their diet.	Feedback_13
we can lessen it by feeding them seaweed.	Feedback_13
we can lower that by turning to plant based alternatives or feeding cows seaweed based food.	Feedback_13
we can lower the amount of methane from feeding seaweed to cows.	Feedback_13
we can reduce their methane output by feeding them seaweed.	Feedback_13
we can substantially reduce the methane by supplementing part of their diet with seaweed.	Feedback_13
we could reduce that by feeding them seaweed.	Feedback_13
we may be able to reduce cow burps by feeding them seaweed, which research has shown reduces methane released from cow burps by 99%.	Feedback_13
you can feed cows seaweed to lessen the methane.	Feedback_13
some scientists think that instead not raising cows for food farmers could change what they feed their cattle so they do not burp as much.	Feedback_13
an alternative would be to change the cow's diet to reduce the methane that they burp out.	Feedback_13
by eating seawood the methane in their burps is reduced 99 percent.	Feedback_13
seeweed eliminates 99% of the methane.	Feedback_13
there is something to be done to reduce that effect, one is to change the cows diet by introducing seeweed, another would be to reduce the amount of meat consumption in order to help the environment.	Feedback_13
seaweed causes way less	Feedback_13
seaweed releases less methan.	Feedback_13
seaweed will reduce the amount of toxins to the atmosphere.	Feedback_13
we can reduce them with seaweed.	Feedback_13
we can change their diet to help eliminate the gas produces by the burps.	Feedback_13
could be less if we change their diet.	Feedback_13
if we changed what they eat the gas they emit could be reduced by 99 percent.	Feedback_13
cows that eat seaweed release up to 99% less gas.	Feedback_13
some scientists and farmers believe that adding seaweed to the cattle's diet will reduce methane emissions by one-third.	Feedback_13
studies find that the expelled gas can be controlled by feeding the cow's alternate food such as seaweed.	Feedback_13
you can reduce thing by feeding them seaweed	Feedback_13
it can be reduced by eating less meat.	Feedback_13
plant based meats are available and are great alternatives for many people; some others think feeding cows seaweed can help.	Feedback_13
seaweed, when fed to cows, has a lesser effect.	Feedback_13
